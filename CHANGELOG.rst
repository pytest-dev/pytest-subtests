0.10.0 (2022-02-15)
-------------------

* Added experimental support for suppressing subtest output dots in non-verbose mode with ``--no-subtests-shortletter`` -- this allows the native pytest column calculations to not be disrupted and minimizes unneeded output for large CI systems.

.. _#70: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests/pull/70

0.7.0 (2022-02-13)
------------------

------------------

* ``pytest>=6.0`` is now required.

  ``SUBFAIL`` and ``u`` for failed ones instead of ``FAILED`` (`#30`_).
